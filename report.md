# VS Code Flex Extension Development Report

## Project Overview

The VS Code Flex extension provides language support for the Flex programming language, including syntax highlighting, code completion, running and debugging Flex programs, and AI-assisted coding. This report documents the development progress, issues resolved, and planned future enhancements.

## Latest Updates

### Cross-Platform Compatibility Improvements (Update: June 2023)

#### Issues Resolved

1. **Fixed USE_AI Environment Variable Issue**
   - The extension was previously setting `USE_AI=true` regardless of user preferences
   - Modified the `run`, `runFile`, and `runWithAI` commands to check the user's AI preference setting
   - Added logic to only set `USE_AI=true` when `flex.ai.enable` is true in settings
   - Updated commands to read the AI model from user settings
   - Added fallback to set `USE_AI=false` when AI is disabled

2. **Fixed VS Code Variable Resolution in Terminal Commands**
   - Terminal commands were using `${workspaceFolder}` which doesn't get resolved by the shell
   - Created a `resolveVariables` function to replace VS Code variables with actual paths
   - Updated all commands to resolve variables before using paths in terminal commands
   - Modified settings to avoid using VS Code variables where possible

3. **Improved Cross-Platform Path Handling**
   - Enhanced the `run-flex.js` script to handle both relative and absolute paths correctly
   - Updated the script to work from any directory, not just the workspace
   - Added proper escaping for paths with spaces or special characters
   - Improved error handling for file paths and script execution
   - Made the script detect and create the appropriate platform-specific script (`run-flex.sh` or `run-flex.bat`)

#### Added Features

1. **Dynamic Sindbad Path Configuration**
   - Added functionality to detect and prompt for Sindbad path if not set
   - Implemented logic to search for Sindbad in common installation locations
   - Added configuration setting for users to specify custom Sindbad path
   - Created validation to ensure the path contains the required interpreter files

2. **Enhanced Run Command Framework**
   - Developed a more robust run command implementation with proper environment variable handling
   - Added support for stopping running processes across different platforms
   - Created a status bar indicator for running Flex programs
   - Improved terminal management for cleaner user experience

3. **Wrapper Script Generation**
   - Implemented dynamic generation of platform-specific wrapper scripts
   - Added support for both Windows (.bat) and Unix-based systems (.sh)
   - Ensured proper permissions are set for executable scripts
   - Added fallback options when scripts cannot be found or created

#### Testing and Verification

Cross-platform compatibility has been tested on:
- macOS 24.3.0 (Darwin)
- Windows 10 (simulated compatibility)
- Ubuntu Linux 22.04 (simulated compatibility)

Tests were conducted by:
1. Running Flex programs with and without AI mode
2. Executing from various directories (workspace root, subdirectories, external directories)
3. Testing with file paths containing spaces and special characters
4. Verifying that user settings are correctly applied

## Current Functionality

The VS Code Flex extension currently provides:

1. **Language Features**
   - Syntax highlighting for Flex code (.lx, .flex, .fx files)
   - Code completion and IntelliSense
   - Code formatting capabilities
   - Navigation (go to definition, find references)
   - Simple refactoring capabilities

2. **Execution Support**
   - Run Flex programs directly from VS Code
   - Run with AI assistance enabled/disabled
   - Stop running programs
   - Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)

3. **AI Integration**
   - Support for multiple AI models (Qwen, OpenAI)
   - AI-assisted code explanation
   - AI-assisted code generation
   - Code translation from other languages to Flex

4. **Settings & Configuration**
   - Configurable Sindbad path
   - AI model selection
   - Enable/disable AI features
   - API key configuration for OpenAI

## Known Issues

1. The extension requires the Sindbad interpreter to be installed separately.
2. AI features require specific model availability based on configuration.
3. Terminal-based execution may behave differently across operating systems.
4. Some special character escape sequences may not work correctly in all shells.
5. The extension does not currently provide a way to customize the command-line arguments for the Flex interpreter.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **"Sindbad path not set" error**
   - Solution: Configure the `flex.sindbadPath` setting in VS Code settings to point to your Sindbad installation directory
   - Alternative: Allow the extension to automatically search for the Sindbad installation

2. **"Cannot run program" error**
   - Solution: Check if Node.js is installed and in your PATH
   - Verify file permissions on Unix systems (`chmod +x run-flex.sh`)
   - Try running the script manually from the terminal

3. **Path with spaces not working correctly**
   - Solution: Ensure the latest version of the extension is installed
   - Manually edit the generated script to properly escape paths

4. **AI features not working**
   - Solution: Verify `flex.ai.enable` is set to `true`
   - Check that the selected AI model is available and properly configured
   - For OpenAI, verify that a valid API key is provided

5. **Permission denied errors**
   - Solution: On Unix systems, run `chmod +x run-flex.sh` to make the script executable
   - On Windows, check execution policies if PowerShell is being used

## Planned Enhancements

1. **Debugging Support**
   - Add breakpoint support
   - Add variable inspection
   - Implement step-through debugging

2. **Enhanced AI Features**
   - Add more AI models
   - Improve code completion with AI
   - Add AI-assisted error fixing

3. **Performance Improvements**
   - Optimize language server
   - Improve startup time
   - Reduce memory usage

4. **Documentation**
   - Create comprehensive documentation
   - Add more code examples
   - Include tutorials for beginners
